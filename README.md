Overview of the project

Here's an overview of a Python program project to calculate the average of grades:

Project Title: Grade Average Calculator

Objective: Create a Python program that calculates the average of a set of grades input by the user.

Features:

1. User input: Allow the user to enter a set of grades (e.g., 85, 90, 78, etc.)
2. Grade storage: Store the input grades in a list or array
3. Average calculation: Calculate the average of the grades using a formula (sum of grades / number of grades)
4. Output: Display the average grade to the user

Example Code:

# Get user input for grades
grades = input("Enter grades (separated by spaces): ")
grades_list = [float(grade) for grade in grades.split()]

# Calculate average grade
average_grade = sum(grades_list) / len(grades_list)

# Display average grade
print("Average grade:", average_grade)

Enhancements:

1. Error handling: Add try-except blocks to handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric grades)
2. Grade validation: Check if grades are within a valid range (e.g., 0-100)
3. Multiple datasets: Allow the user to input multiple sets of grades and calculate averages for each set
4. Grade distribution: Display a distribution of grades (e.g., histogram, bar chart)

Skills Demonstrated:

1. User input and output
2. Data storage and manipulation (lists/arrays)
3. Basic calculations (sum, average)
4. Error handling and validation

This project is great for beginners to practice fundamental Python concepts and build a useful tool for students or educators.
